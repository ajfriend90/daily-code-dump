# daily-code-dump

A dump of coding exercises produced from a goal to code and commit something daily.

## Purpose

This repository exists to support a simple, non-negotiable habit:  
**get daily keyboard time writing pure code and commit it to GitHub.**

The contents of this repo are intentionally unrestricted. Exercises may be:

- From any programming language
- From any source (primarily Codewars)
- Any difficulty level
- Ugly, pretty, optimal, suboptimal
- Useful or completely useless

The goal is **consistency**, not curation.

This repo is not meant to be a portfolio or a showcase. It is a living log of daily practice intended to compound coding ability, reinforce problem-solving fundamentals, and maintain regular Git usage.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized loosely by language. Each top-level folder corresponds to a programming language, with no additional enforced structure.

Example:
/python
/javascript
/java

This provides light organization without introducing overhead or friction.

Commit discipline will be simple messages.

Example: 
daily practice: 2025-12-21

Again to remove decision fatigue, friction, and to make streaks visually obvious. 

## Naming Convention

Files follow a simple, descriptive naming format:
/kata-name
/KataName

Examples:
- `reversed-strings.js`
- `StringScramble.java`

This ensures:
- Each day’s work is clearly identifiable
- Minimal cognitive load when naming files
- Easy chronological scanning of progress

## Rules

- At least one coding exercise is committed every day, but goal is 20 mins keyboard time daily
- Small, easy solutions are acceptable
- Partial or imperfect solutions are acceptable
- If I miss a day, aim for 40 mins the next day
